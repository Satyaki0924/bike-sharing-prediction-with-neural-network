#Bike-Sharing-Predictions
This project is build up completely with numpy.
It implements basic neural network concepts including backpropagation,
hidden layers, activation function and gradient descent.

To run the project, open 'run_me.py' and set the epoch, learning rate and number of hidden layers.

The terminal must show similar output:
